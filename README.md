# DNA-AlignmentProgram
 Scientists measure how closely related a species is by looking at the DNA sequences for key
 proteins and seeing how similar/dissimilar they are. If the two sequences of DNA are essentially
 the same, the two species are considered to be evolutionarily closer since there is a relationship
 between changes and time. This process is called sequence alignment.
 
 This program helps do that.
